Just walked out of the theater after seeing The Parenting, and wow, can I talk about confusion in cinematic form? It’s like they tossed a blender full of clichés, slightly sarcastic narrators, and heart-pulling moments… and then forgot to put the lid on. Result? Chaos. Beautiful, messy chaos.

First off, I'm not going to lie, feels like I just ran a marathon. My brain’s exhausted from trying to piece together the plot. You ever try to assemble IKEA furniture with missing instructions? Yeah, like that. Of course, there are parts that hit deep, and I don't mean deep like profound. I mean deep like a toddler's wading pool — deceptively shallow, but enough to splash about in. The lead actor, whoever he is, had exactly three expressions on his face, one of which was best described as a constipated surprise. Kinda endearing, in its own weird way.

Okay, so the parents in this movie, they're just... wow. If parenting were a dance recital, they'd have two left feet and a propensity for stepping on toes. But that’s kinda the charm, right? Watching them stumble, fall, and somehow just keep rolling as if gravity was an optional theory. Approaching parenting like they're climbing Mount Everest in flip-flops and a tank top. Totally insane, yet here I am rooting for them.

> There’s this one scene involving a spaghetti disaster — more pasta on walls than on plates — and it’s like, is this a metaphor for life or just a PSA for takeout? Don’t know, don’t care. Can't stop thinking about the mess. I’ll be dreaming about marinara tonight. 

While I was sitting there, actually contemplating whether I left the stove on, there were moments where the humor hit just right. Those one-liners that slipped past the radar only to detonate afterward, leaving you to giggle like an idiot long after the moment’s passed.

Anyway, enough of my incoherent babbling. There’s a small piece of me that wants to download the movie just to watch that mayhem unfold again, maybe from the comfort of my couch, where there are fewer sticky floors. Don’t ask me why here’s a piece of code I found somewhere (definitely leaked from their editing room if you ask me): `alert(Chaos Level: Maximum);`. Don’t know what it does, don’t really care.

So, if chaotic parenting, missteps, and heart-felt disorder sounds like your jam, maybe peek at The Parenting. Or don’t. I dunno, I’m just a slightly bewildered, pasta-dream haunted moviegoer.
